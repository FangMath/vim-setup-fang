This is some files to personalize your vim. It includes some plugins, as well as a .vimrc file.

To install, simply move (mv) the .vimrc file as ~/.vimrc, and put all other files in the directory of "~/.vim/".

The plugins include the "nerdtree", "matlab syntax" and some other plugins which I couldn't remember exactly...

Thanks for your interest! :P
