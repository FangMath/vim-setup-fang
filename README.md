This is my vim setup files. It includes all the plugins, as well as the .vimrc file.

To use it, simply mv the .vimrc file as ~/.vimrc, and put all the rest files in the folder "~/.vim/".

The plugins include the "nerdtree", and some other plugins which I couldn't remember exactly...

Thanks for your interest! :P
